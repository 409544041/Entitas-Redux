# Entitas Redux

## About
Entitas Redux is a reworked version of [Entitas](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp) with a sole focus on Unity. For more background on this project, see [here](BACKGROUND.md) for more information.

## Requirements
* **Min Unity Version**: 2019.4
* **Scripting Runtime**: .Net 4.X

## Installing Entitas Redux and Getting Started

For instructions on installing Entitas Redux and how to get up and running, see [here](https://github.com/jeffcampbellmakesgames/Entitas-Redux/wiki/Getting-Started) on the wiki.

## Usage

Entitas Redux at the moment is largely representative of the features present in `v1.13.0` of Entitas. As a temporary solution for now, I would point you to the Entitas Wiki [here](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/wiki/Tutorials) for a breakdown on features and documentation on usage. In the future, EntitasRedux documentation and code examples will be hosted on this repository's wiki [here](https://github.com/jeffcampbellmakesgames/Entitas-Redux/wiki).

## Support
If this is useful to you and/or youâ€™d like to see future development and more tools in the future, please consider supporting it either by contributing to the Github projects (submitting bug reports or features and/or creating pull requests) or by buying me coffee using any of the links below. Every little bit helps!
